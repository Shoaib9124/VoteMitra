📝 Overview
VoteMitra is a blockchain-powered voting and polling system designed to ensure secure, transparent, and tamper-proof elections. By leveraging Ethereum smart contracts and QR code authentication, VoteMitra prevents fraud, guarantees voter anonymity, and allows real-time result tracking.

🚀 Features
✅ Blockchain-Powered Security – Votes are recorded on Ethereum, preventing tampering.
✅ QR Code Authentication – Ensures only authorized users can vote.
✅ Smart Contracts – Handles voting logic and result verification.
✅ User-Friendly UI – Designed for easy navigation and smooth voting experience.
✅ Scalability – Can handle large-scale elections with minimal overhead.


🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Solidity (Ethereum Smart Contracts), Web3.js
Blockchain: Ethereum (Using Ganache for local blockchain development)
Other Tools: Python, QR Code Authentication

🎯 How It Works
1️⃣ User scans a QR code to verify identity.
2️⃣ Smart contract verifies eligibility and prevents duplicate voting.
3️⃣ Vote is cast and stored on the Ethereum blockchain.
4️⃣ Results are displayed in real-time, ensuring transparency.

📦 Installation & Setup
🔹 Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js & npm
Metamask Wallet (for interacting with the blockchain)
Ganache or an Ethereum test network

🔹 Steps to Run Locally
1.Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Shoaib9124/VoteMitra.git

2.Compile and Deploy Smart Contracts
truffle compile
truffle migrate --network development

3.Connect Metamask and Vote!



🛡️ Security Measures
✔ Immutable Voting Records – Once a vote is cast, it cannot be changed.
✔ Tamper-Proof Smart Contracts – No manual intervention possible.
✔ QR Code-Based Authentication – No unauthorized access.

📌 Future Enhancements
🔹 Implement multi-chain support for scalability.
🔹 Introduce biometric authentication for enhanced security.
🔹 Enable mobile voting with blockchain-based identity verification.
